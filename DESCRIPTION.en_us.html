  
<p>Alatsi is an original typeface designed by <a href="https://www.2xux.com/">Spyros Zevelakis.</a></p>
<p>Alatsi is a semicondensed geometric sans design.</p>
<p>Alatsi feels familiar, calm, trustable and contemporary. 
 It is a little lighthearted or casual in feeling as well. The contemporary feeling comes from the treatment of terminals and the cheekily pointed V A W. The calmness from the modest x height. Alatsi offers a wide range of figures including Oldstyle figures, small numbers including superiors and fractions. Alata also offers case sensitive forms.</p>
