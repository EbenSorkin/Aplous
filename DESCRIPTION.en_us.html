<p>Alatsi is a semicondensed geometric sans typeface.</p>
<p>Alatsi feels familiar, calm, trustable and contemporary. 
 It is a little lighthearted or casual in feeling as 
 well. The contemporary feeling comes from the treatment 
 of terminals and the cheekily pointed V A W. 
 The calmness from the modest x height. Alatsi offers a wide 
 range of figures including Oldstyle figures, small numbers 
 including superiors and fractions. Alata also offers case 
 sensitive forms.</p>
